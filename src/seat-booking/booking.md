## Problem Statement: My Theatre Seat Booking System

My Theatre requires a user-friendly and efficient online seat booking application to manage seat selection, display availability, and process reservations across its three distinct seating categories: Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

The current system lacks a streamlined method for users to visualize seat availability, select desired seats, and receive immediate cost estimates. This leads to potential inefficiencies in the booking process, customer frustration, and inaccurate tracking of reserved seats.

The primary objective is to develop a web-based application that allows users to:

1.  **Visually select seats:** Enable users to intuitively choose seats from a graphical representation of the theater layout, with clear visual indicators for seat status (available/booked).
2.  **Display real-time seat availability:** Instantly update seat availability, with available seats marked in **green** and selected/booked seats in **red**.
3.  **Calculate and display total cost:** Provide an immediate and accurate calculation of the total booking cost based on the selected seats and their respective category prices (Silver: Rs 200, Gold: Rs 300, Platinum: Rs 500).
4.  **Block selected seats:** Securely block chosen seats upon user confirmation to prevent double-booking.

This system aims to enhance the customer booking experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure accurate revenue tracking for My Theatre.
